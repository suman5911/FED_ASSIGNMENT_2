HTML builds the structure of the webpage and css make webpage clean and modern.

After, i create a css file for give a style and color to every part of the webpage.

A. While in this assignmnet i not face a lot challenges, i easly write html code and css, but i face problem when set colors for background or 
different color for every section.

look to my work. One of the most important thing i want to add in my work is animation and color combination.
